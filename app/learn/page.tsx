          <p>
            Bitcoin is the world&apos;s first decentralized digital currency, created in 2009 by an anonymous entity known as Satoshi Nakamoto. It allows peer-to-peer transactions without the need for intermediaries like banks, making it a revolutionary form of money.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-4'>
            Bitcoin operates on a decentralized ledger called the blockchain, where all transactions are recorded and verified by a network of computers (nodes) around the world. This ensures transparency, security, and immutability.

        <>
          <p>
            Bitcoin transactions are grouped into blocks, which are added to the blockchain through a process called mining. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical problems, and the first miner to solve the problem gets to add the block and earn Bitcoin rewards.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-4'>
            The Bitcoin network adjusts the difficulty of these problems to ensure that blocks are added approximately every 10 minutes, maintaining a steady supply of new Bitcoins.

        <>
          <p>
            Bitcoin mining is the process of validating transactions and securing the Bitcoin network. Miners use specialized hardware to solve cryptographic puzzles, and in return, they are rewarded with newly minted Bitcoins and transaction fees.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-4'>
            Mining is essential for maintaining the integrity of the Bitcoin blockchain, as it prevents double-spending and ensures that all transactions are legitimate.

          <p>
            Decentralization is the core principle of Bitcoin. It means that no single entity controls the network, making it resistant to censorship, corruption, and manipulation.
          </p>
          <p className='mt-4'>
            This decentralized nature empowers individuals by giving them full control over their money, without relying on traditional financial institutions.

            Bitcoin mining has been criticized for its energy consumption, but it also presents an opportunity to drive innovation in renewable energy. At Potentia, we leverage renewable energy sources to power our mining operations, reducing our carbon footprint and promoting sustainability.

          <p className='mt-4'>
            By using renewable energy, we not only make mining more environmentally friendly but also more cost-effective, ensuring long-term profitability.
